# first-webpage

Just an old attempt to get used to Git and GitHub with a simple static page made with [SoloLearn](www.sololearn.com)

# Update 29 August 2021

[NOW FIXED] GitHub Pages didn't set right away for me, because my main html file name wasn't index.html

### No idea why [NOW FIXED]

Even after add, commit, push with some minor changes it cannot see the Source:

`Branch: main` `/ (root)`

It can instead just show this updated README.md after I switched `/ (root)` to `/doc` and viceversa

So... I guess this README.md is my first-page now XD

## *CORRECTED*

In order to make ***project into a webpage*** with GitHub Pages

0. Be sure to have a `index.html` and all your files pushed into GitHub repository
1. Go to your repo `Settings`
    - if you want a different [***type of page***][1] be save your ***personal/organization page*** with appropriate name "extension"
2. Go to `Pages` and set your [preferences][2] even if your like a [Jekyll][3] theme

* Alternatively go directly to <https://github.com/username/reponame/settings/pages> \
    (with your `username` `reponame`)
