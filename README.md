# first-webpage

Just an old attempt to get used to Git and GitHub with a simple static page made with [SoloLearn](www.sololearn.com)

# Update 29 August 2021

No idea why GitHub Pages doesn't set

## No idea why

Even after add, commit, push with some minor changes it cannot see the Source:

`Branch: main` `/ (root)`

It can instead just show this updated README.md after I switched `/ (root)` to `/doc` and viceversa

So... I guess this README.md is my first-page now XD
